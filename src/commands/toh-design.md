## Anti-Patterns Checklist

Will check and fix these issues:

- [ ] Purple/violet gradients → Solid blue
- [ ] Pure black text → Slate-900
- [ ] Inconsistent padding → Unified scale
- [ ] Too many font weights → Max 2-3
- [ ] Bounce animations → Subtle ease
- [ ] Generic placeholder → Realistic content
- [ ] Round-3xl everything → Contextual radius

## Rules

1. **ALWAYS** maintain functionality while improving looks
2. **ALWAYS** keep changes subtle, not dramatic
3. **NEVER** change color scheme without reason
4. **NEVER** add decorative elements that don't serve purpose
